# Object Oriented Programming: Encapsulation
Our activity for our course Object Oriented Programming.

## Problem Statement 

You are tasked with developing a software system for managing a library. One of the key components of this system is the management of books within the library. Your task is to create a Java class to represent a Book, ensuring that its properties are encapsulated and accessible only through controlled methods. 


## Requirements
Your Book class **should have the following features**: 


1. **Encapsulation**: The properties of a book, including its title, author, and number of pages, should be encapsulated within the class, preventing direct access from outside.
   
2. **Constructor**: Implement a constructor that initializes the title, author, and number of pages of a book when an instance of the class is created. 

3. **Getter Methods**: Provide getter methods to retrieve the title, author, and number of pages of a book. These methods should allow controlled access to the encapsulated properties, ensuring data integrity and abstraction.
